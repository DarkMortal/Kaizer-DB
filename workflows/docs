Key Points in the Workflow:
Trigger on Push:

The workflow triggers when changes are pushed to the main branch or any branch starting with release/.
Set Up Node.js:

The actions/setup-node action sets up a Node.js environment compatible with your project.
Install Dependencies:

yarn install ensures all project dependencies are installed.
Run Tests:

Include a test step to ensure code quality before publishing. Update yarn test if your test script differs.
Publish to NPM:

The npm publish command pushes your package to the NPM registry.
NODE_AUTH_TOKEN is a secret stored in your repository settings, granting permission to publish to NPM.
Version Bumping:

Automatically bump the version number using npm version. Adjust the patch to minor or major depending on your release strategy.
Push Changes:

The new version number and associated commit are pushed back to the repository.
Additional Steps:
Set Up NPM_TOKEN:

In your repository, go to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions.
Add a new secret named NPM_TOKEN with your NPM authentication token.
Test Locally:

Before committing the workflow file, ensure your package.json is configured correctly for publishing to NPM.
Versioning Strategy:

Decide whether to manually or automatically handle version bumps. Adjust the workflow accordingly.
